# ADR-06: Implement Continuous Learning with Feedback Loop

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-10-19

## Context
Static ML models degrade over time as user behavior, traffic, and environmental conditions change.
To maintain accuracy, MobilityCorpâ€™s predictive and generative models must learn continuously from real-world telemetry and feedback.

## Decision
Deploy a **Continuous Learning Pipeline** that:
1. Logs every prediction outcome (actual vs forecasted demand, SoC depletion).
2. Collects field staff feedback (route success, travel time deviations).
3. Retrains models nightly or weekly via an orchestrator (Airflow/Vertex AI).
4. Promotes new models only after A/B validation passes KPI thresholds.

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Model drift minimized through regular retraining.
- Improves forecast reliability and route quality.
- Supports experiment tracking and lineage.

**Negative:**
- Adds operational overhead for MLOps.
- Risk of degraded performance if feedback data is noisy.

## Alternatives Considered
- Manual model retraining (rejected: too slow, non-scalable).
- Continuous online learning (rejected: risk of instability and overfitting).
