# ADR-09: Agentic Workflow for Trip Planning
**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-10-21

## Context
We are tackling the challenge that most of our customers only use our service on an ad-hoc basis. We would like more of them to rely on us on a regular basis like daily commmute. 

## Current Pain Point
- User uses our app as an ad-hoc to their daily navigation apps(google maps, apple maps etc.). They need to switch over to our app for booking. The booking experience is not seamless.
- They usually only come to us when their navigation app suggests that no public transport alternatives are available or it's too far for walking.
- As a result, their trip planning experience involves a lot of extra thinking.
- The vehicle booking experience can be too length. For first timers, if they are in a rush, first finding the route, then setting up their account and finally locating a bike is usually too much of a hassle. Many users quit when feeling like there are too many steps.
